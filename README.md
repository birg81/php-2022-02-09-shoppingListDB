# php-2022-02-09-shoppingListDB
Hi guys.
I developed this PHP code, for demonstration purposes.
This code simulates a shopping list, like the one used by mom at the supermarket.
The code is written in PHP and MySQL.
I wrote a PHP script that allows you to automatically create the DB within the DBMS, if it is not already present (./listaSpesaDB.sql.php).
I also wrote a configuration file (./config.inc.php), by modifying this file you can change the DB settings.
I also used javascript, in fact there is also a page (leggivoci.html) this page, through the javasript fecth() function, makes an ajax request to a php page (./listaspesa.json.php with content-type: application/json ), this page, like a Servlet, returns the list of items in json format.
You shouldn't have too much trouble in tweaking the code and make everything work.
In case of difficulties, do not hesitate to contact me.

Good luck!
